                    dbt_project.yml - EXPLAINED FOR BEGINNERS
================================================================================

WHAT IS THIS FILE?
------------------
The dbt_project.yml is like the "settings file" for your entire dbt project.
Think of it as the control center that tells dbt:
  - What your project is called
  - Where to find your SQL files
  - How to build your models (as views or tables)

KEY CONCEPTS:
-------------

1. PROJECT NAME (name: 'shopify_analytics')
   - Must be lowercase with underscores only
   - Used to reference models from other projects
   - Appears in your database schema names

2. PROFILE (profile: 'default')
   - Links to your ~/.dbt/profiles.yml file
   - Contains your database credentials (BigQuery, Snowflake, etc.)
   - Never commit credentials to git!

3. FILE PATHS
   - model-paths: Where your SQL transformation files live
   - seed-paths: Where CSV files for loading go
   - macro-paths: Where reusable SQL functions are stored

4. MATERIALIZATIONS
   - VIEW: A saved query, no data storage, always fresh
   - TABLE: Actual data stored, faster to query, uses storage
   - INCREMENTAL: Only processes new/changed rows (advanced)
   - EPHEMERAL: Exists only as CTE in other models

5. SCHEMA CONFIGURATION (+schema: staging)
   - Controls which schema/dataset models are created in
   - Results in: {target_schema}_{custom_schema}
   - Example: if target is "analytics" → creates "analytics_staging"

FOLDER HIERARCHY:
-----------------
models/
├── staging/          # Raw data cleaning - materialized as VIEWS
│   └── shopify/      # Source-specific staging
└── marts/            # Business-ready tables - materialized as TABLES
    └── core/         # Core business entities

WHY THIS STRUCTURE?
-------------------
- Separation of concerns: Each layer has a specific job
- Staging = Clean raw data, rename columns, cast types
- Marts = Join staging models, add business logic

COMMON COMMANDS:
----------------
dbt run                 # Build all models
dbt run -s staging      # Build only staging models
dbt test                # Run all tests
dbt build               # Run + Test together
dbt compile             # Generate SQL without running
