            WHY DBT SEED ISN'T IDEAL FOR YOUR SHOPIFY DATA
================================================================================

You asked: "Can we store it in seeds folder and run dbt seed?"

TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE? ❌ No (for JSONL files)
BETTER APPROACH? ✅ Manual upload to BigQuery

Here's why:

================================================================================
                           DBT SEED LIMITATIONS
================================================================================

1. **FILE FORMAT**: Only CSV files
   - ✅ CSV, TSV files work
   - ❌ JSONL, JSON, XML don't work
   - Your Shopify data is JSONL with nested arrays

2. **DATA SIZE**: Meant for small reference data
   - ✅ Country codes, product categories (small)
   - ❌ Transactional data like orders (can be millions of rows)

3. **USE CASE**: Static reference data
   - ✅ Data that rarely changes
   - ❌ Data that gets updated frequently

================================================================================
                           WHAT WE JUST DEMONSTRATED
================================================================================

We put your JSONL file in seeds/ and ran `dbt seed`:

BEFORE:
```
seeds/
├── .gitkeep
└── shopify_orders.jsonl  ← Your data
```

AFTER running `dbt seed`:
```
seeds/
├── .gitkeep
├── shopify_orders.jsonl  ← Still there (ignored!)
└── country_codes.csv     ← Added this CSV
```

RESULT: dbt seed created `dbt_training.country_codes` table in BigQuery
        But COMPLETELY IGNORED your JSONL file!

================================================================================
                           BETTER APPROACHES FOR YOUR DATA
================================================================================

OPTION 1: MANUAL UPLOAD (What we recommend)
------------------------------------------
✅ Handles any file format (JSONL, CSV, etc.)
✅ Preserves nested structures
✅ One-time setup
✅ Works with large datasets

Steps:
1. BigQuery Console → Create dataset `raw_shopify`
2. Upload your JSONL file → Table `orders`
3. Done! dbt can now read it

OPTION 2: CONVERT TO CSV (Complex, not recommended)
---------------------------------------------------
❌ Would lose nested array data
❌ Complex flattening required
❌ Not version-control friendly
❌ Still need manual upload

OPTION 3: USE AN ETL TOOL (For production)
-------------------------------------------
✅ Airbyte, Fivetran, Stitch
✅ Automated data loading
✅ Handles complex schemas
❌ More setup required

================================================================================
                           YOUR CURRENT SITUATION
================================================================================

You have two choices:

CHOICE A: Manual Upload (Recommended)
-------------------------------------
1. Upload JSONL to BigQuery manually (once)
2. Use dbt to transform it
3. ✅ Simple, works perfectly

CHOICE B: Try to force dbt seed (Not recommended)
-----------------------------------------------
1. Convert JSONL to CSV (lose nested data)
2. Put CSV in seeds/
3. Run dbt seed
4. ❌ Complex, loses data structure

================================================================================
                           QUICK VERIFICATION
================================================================================

Check if your data is already loaded:

```sql
-- Run in BigQuery console
SELECT
  COUNT(*) as total_orders,
  MIN(created_at) as earliest_order,
  MAX(created_at) as latest_order
FROM `saras-bigquery.raw_shopify.orders`
```

If this returns data → You're ready to run dbt!
If this fails → You need to upload the data first.

================================================================================
                           RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

**Use manual upload to BigQuery.** It's the right tool for your Shopify data.

dbt seed is great for:
- Country codes
- Product categories  
- Static reference data

Your Shopify orders are transactional data that belongs in BigQuery directly.
